# The design

## Type of ventilator

Our ventilator, the AIRone, is a ventilator that can be used the same way as is accustomed on the Intensive Care in the Netherlands. The AIRone works as a regular, pressure-regulated ventilator, but with less functionality. The minimum requirements of a ventilator to provide sufficient artificial respiration were set up in close contact with experts from Leiden University Medical Center and Erasmus Medical Center. Functionalities that are not vital for efficient artificial respiration, were omitted in the AIRone. The ventilator is to be connected to the existing oxygen and compressed air outlets in Dutch hospitals.

## Settings

With our system the settings can be altered to the clinical condition of the patient. Using a touchscreen (Graphic User Interface) health care workers are able to change the following parameters:

* Respiratory rate (RR)
* Inspiration/expiration ratio (I/E ratio)
* Inspiratory pressure (Pinsp)
* Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
* Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)

The screen will visualize the pressure and flow curves. These are required for assessment of the clinical condition of the patient.

## Intended use

The AIRone is designed as an emergency solution for artificial respiration of patients affected by COVID-19. It is only to be used when there is a shortage of regular ventilators. If this situation occurs, the AIRone is intended to be used for sedated patients who require intensive care due to COVID-19.

## Open-source availability

The design and documentation of the AIRone is available on this [website](https://osf.io/mn7xq/).
