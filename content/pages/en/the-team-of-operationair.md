OperationAIR is a non-profit student team, consisting of 50 studentens from Delft University of Technology. The initiative was started by prof. dr.ir. Jaap Harlaar, director of the educational program Technical Medicine, and students MSc Technical Medicine. In the meantime, the team has become multidisciplinary with the addition of students Biomedial Enineering, Industrial Design, Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering. All participants of OperationAIR work with great enthusiasm on a volunteer basis, without conflict of interest.

## Subteams

The team consists of three departments:

* **Management & Communication (M&C)**\
  Internal and external communication is facilitated by M&C. Also financial, legal and regulatory aspects of design and production of our ventilator are managed from this department.
* **Design**\
  Team Design focuses in the requirements, design, prototyping and development of our intended ventilator.
* **Scenario & Realization**\
  To predict the possible demand in out mechanical ventilators, we made prediction models on the national contamination curve based on RIVM data. Team Scenario & Realization also analysed the occupation of the intensive care capacity in the Netherlands. The team is also responsible for the implementation strategy to introduce our ventilator as soon as possible in times of crisis
