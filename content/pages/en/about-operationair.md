# Over OperationAIR

OperationAIR - Assist In Respiration - is a student team of the TU Delft that tries to develop a simple and relatively cheap ventilator that can serve as an emergency solution when a shortage occurs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation in Italy has shown that the outbreak can lead to a shortage of ventilators for patients that are in need of intensive care. Doctors are then required to consider how to distribute the ventilators. The patients that do not receive artificial respiration, have an increased risk of death. For this patient population we want to provide an emergency solution. That is why the initiative of OperationAIR was started on March 16, 2020.

## Vision

The vision of OperationAIR is to bring technical and clinical knowledge together to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. With the knowledge and effort of students and experts from various organizations, we hope to be able to make a difference. Together we can achieve more!

The most important requirements of our design is that it is safe, quickly upscalable and relatively easy to use. It is not our goal to replace the currently available ventilators. This ventilator is being developed for the potential situation of a shortage of regular ventilators.

## For who?

Our primary goal is to develop a ventilator that can save lives when a shortage occurs in the Netherlands. Therefore, the initial aim is to produce and implement our design in the Netherlands. The design and all additional information will become publicly available for other countries. This way OperationAIR hopes to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

The ventilator is being developed for hospitals that are having trouble with providing respiration aid due to a shortage of ventilators. Are you in need of emergency ventilators to be able to provide intensive care, please contact us via [info@operationair.org](mailto:info@operationair.org).

## Expert support

OperationAIR has daily contact with intensivists and technical physicians from the Leidens University Medical Center (LUMC) and the Erasmus University Medical Center (Erasmus MC) to stay updated about the current situation at the Intensive Care Units. Furthermore, OperationAIR has been in contact with TU Eindhoven about the expected curve of the number of contaminations and the need for an emergency solution. To optimize the development of our ventilator, we also have contact with various companies and organizations.
