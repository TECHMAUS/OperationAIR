# Air for All

OperationAIR is part of 'Air for All', an umbrella initiative of TU Delft that consists of three projects, each devoted to developing a different type of ventilator. This group consists of: 

1. **OperationAIR** - dedicated breathing system that as close as reasonably possible complies with safety regulations and will be usable within the Dutch hospital infrastructure.
2. **BTB-Breathe** - a dedicated breathing system designed with the absolute minimum of parts, usable within and outside the Dutch hospital infrastructure.
3. **Project Inspiration** - a dedicated breathing system with a mechanical â€“ analogic basis, suitable for use outside the hospital setting (i.e. in emergency overflow facilities), or in low income countries.

Our broader portfolio enables us to work together to address the global shortage of ventilators. More information can be found at this [website](https://tudelft-bmech-coronavirus.nl/).
