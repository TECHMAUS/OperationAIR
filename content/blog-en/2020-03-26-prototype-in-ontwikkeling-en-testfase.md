The last few days there have been a lot of developments within the team of OperationAir.

We have been working hard on different prototypes for which we have received all the necessary components. A testing team has started with the testing protocols and on Sunday there will be a test lung available to test the prototypes thoroughly. The Design team is working hard on this and is striving towards finishing a prototype at the end of this week or the beginning of next week.

In addition, the scaling of the design is being researched. We are in contact with multiple parties regarding this issue. If the prototype gets through the tests well, we could get a clinical approval and with help, we could try to start the production at the end of next week.

For the distribution of the final product we are in contact with the National Coordination Point (or “Landelijk Coördinatiepunt”).

The situation at hand is an extraordinary one, that no one is familiar with, which makes it even more important to us that the machine can be implemented as safely as possible into hospitals. We are looking into different ways to achieve this. The focus is on risk management, to be able to support the healthcare professionals in their justification for using the product. We have made a lot of progress in the risk analysis and at the moment we are having multiple experts give us feedback on it. 

Meanwhile, the realisation team is working on the production and implementation. With Deloitte’s help, an efficient supply chain is being created. In addition, we are creating a platform for future users of the machine with more information about the machine and its use and we are looking into training possibilities. 

We are curious to see how the rest of the week will go and are working hard to realise the production of our machine. We hope to give further positive updates next week!
