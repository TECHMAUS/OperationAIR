The first day, the team (mostly through Skype) met up under the supervision of Jaap. Creating structure was the highest priority. The interested students were split up in 3 teams to work as quickly and efficiently as possible. The teams that were formed are Management & Communication, Scenario and Design. 

Management & Communication will structure the team internally as well as externally. The focus of Scenario for the first week will be to map out the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands, and predominantly the ICU admissions. Design will, for now, focus on the design requirements. Specifically: what are the necessary components of respiratory equipment specific to corona patients? These minimal requirements will be used for the first steps of the design.
