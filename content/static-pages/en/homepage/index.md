  title: Technical Medicine
  content: OperationAIR is an initiative started by students MSc [Technical
    Medicine](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/technical-medicine/msc-technical-medicine/).
    The study program of Technical Medicine was founded in 2014 by Delft
    University of Technology, in collaboration with Leiden University Medical
    Center and Erasmus Medical Center. The study program focuses on the gap
    between the worlds of engineering and medicine, as technologies applied
    within hospitals become more complex over time. Examples hereof are robotic
    surgery and decision support algorithms. Introduction and application of
    these technologies require a specialist with technical and medical
    insight.  A Technical Physician operates in the clinic and partakes in
    patient care. From this position they focus on the implementation and
    application of new technologies to improve patient care.
