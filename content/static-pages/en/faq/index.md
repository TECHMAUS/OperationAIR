title: FAQ
questions:
  - question: What is OperationAIR?
    answer: OperationAIR (Assist In Respiration) is an initiative from the Technical
      University of Delft. The team, consisting of 50 masterstudents under
      supervision of prof. dr. ir. Jaap Harlaar (director of studies Technical
      Medicine), has developed an emergency ventilator for covid-19 patients,
      named "AIRone", for when a potential shortage of ventilators occurs.
  - question: Why did we initiate OperationAIR?
    answer: Due to the fast spreading of COVID-19 the number of patients that are
      hospitalized in Intensive Care, has increased. In the worst-case scenario
      a shortage of ventilators arises in the Netherlands due to this increase.
      In such a situation the difficult consideration has to be made who is to
      receive intensive care. By developing this ventilator we hope to be able
      to provide intensive care for those affected by the shortage.
  - question: What does OperationAIR do?
    answer: We investigate all different scenarios regarding demand for ventilators
      in the Netherlands. The aim is to develop a ventilator that can be used in
      emergencies caused by a shortage.
  - question: How long will it take before the ventilators can be implemented?
    answer: We are currently busy with building the first prototype and hope to be
      testing it soon. As we are dependant of several external factors, the
      moment of implementation is still unsure.
  - question: For whom are the ventilators produced and is it available for everyone?
    answer: The ventilators are developed for in-hospital use on locations with a
      shortage of regular mechanical ventilators. We are regularly in contact
      with intensive care doctors of Leiden University Medical Center and the
      national network for acute medicine (LNAZ). Only when our prototype passes
      the necessary tests, we will openly share the design on our website.
  - question: I want to help, how can I contribute?
    answer: We are flattered by the amount of support offers. To maintain an
      overview of the offered help and suggestions, we would like to ask you to
      fill out the form via the link below. We then may contact you or you
      organisation for help! For international inquiries please contact

  - question: How do you act on national guidelines and advice regarding infection
      prevention, social distancing and working from home?
    answer: Our team operates conform the national guidelines against the spread of
      COVID-19. Many of our team members work from home. Some team members need
      to come to the faculty in person, to build and design the prototype. Those
      members work in small groups, spread across the faculty and keep a
      distance of 1.5 meter at all times. OperationAIR set up an infection
      protocol, which states that members with light symptoms of COVID-19 should
      stay at home and work from there. It also states that upon arrival at
      oneâ€™s workstation and multiple times per day, his/her laptop must be
      cleaned using alcohol wipes. The same is true for washing hands for at
      least 20 seconds with soap. Furthermore, team members keep each other up
      to date via online meetings on platforms as Skype and Zoom
  - question: Is OperationAIR also working on production and implementation in other
      countries?
    answer: "When a clinically approved design is realized, for now, the aim is to
      produce and implement the ventilator in the Netherlands only. The design
      and all additional information will be made public, so other countries can
      use the design for production as well. "
